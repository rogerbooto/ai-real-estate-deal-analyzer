# --- Provider API keys ---
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx      # Required only if using OpenAI for LLM or vision

# --- LLM / Orchestration ---
AIREAL_LLM_MODE=0              # 0 = deterministic pipeline only
                               # 1 = enable LLM/CrewAI orchestration layer
AIREAL_DEBUG=1                 # 1 = verbose logging for development/demo
CREWAI_MODEL=gpt-5             # Model to use for CrewAI orchestration (when enabled)

# --- Financial modeling assumptions ---
AIREAL_CAP_DRIFT_BPS=5         # Annual cap rate drift in basis points (e.g., 5 = +0.05%/yr)
AIREAL_APPRECIATION_PCT=0.03   # Annual property appreciation rate (fraction, e.g., 0.03 = +3%/yr)
AIREAL_STRESS_ADJ=0.0          # Stress-test adjustment factor (additive to cap/appreciation)

# --- Computer vision (photo tagging) ---
AIREAL_USE_VISION=0            # 0 = disable AI vision, deterministic filename heuristics only
                               # 1 = enable AI vision (provider chosen below)
AIREAL_VISION_PROVIDER=mock    # mock = deterministic fake provider for tests
                               # openai = use OpenAI Vision API (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
AIREAL_PHOTO_AGENT=0           # 0 = bypass PhotoTaggerAgent (call cv_tagging directly)
                               # 1 = enable PhotoTaggerAgent policy (delegates to cv_tagging)

# --- Vision provider configuration ---
AIREAL_VISION_MODEL=gpt-5      # Model name to use if provider supports multiple vision models
AIREAL_VISION_TIMEOUT_S=20     # Max seconds to wait per vision request
AIREAL_VISION_MAX_RETRIES=3    # Number of retries for transient vision provider failures
