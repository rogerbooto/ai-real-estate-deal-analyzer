# The AI Real Estate Deal Analyzer

An autonomous AI co-pilot that ingests a real estate listing and user-provided market data to perform a rigorous, Grant Cardone–inspired investment analysis, generating a comprehensive financial breakdown and a human-readable investment thesis.

This project is a portfolio piece designed to showcase a modern, multi-agent AI architecture for complex decision-making and analysis.

## The Problem: Analysis Paralysis in Real Estate Investing

For an aspiring real estate investor, evaluating a potential deal is a time-consuming, manual, and error-prone process. It involves:

- Manually parsing property photos and descriptions.
- Scouring multiple websites for comparable sales ("comps").
- Plugging dozens of numbers into a complex spreadsheet.
- Making a high-stakes financial decision based on incomplete data and gut feeling.

This "analysis paralysis" prevents many would-be investors from ever taking action.

## The Solution: An Autonomous AI Co-pilot

This project solves the problem by deploying a team of specialized AI agents that work together to perform a comprehensive deal analysis in seconds. It acts as an expert co-pilot, handling the heavy lifting of data analysis and financial modeling, allowing the human investor to focus on the final decision.

The system's unique value is its **opinionated financial model**, which implements the core principles of Grant Cardone's real estate investment methodology to calculate critical metrics like Net Operating Income (NOI), Cash-on-Cash Return, and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).

## Technical Architecture

The system is built as a **multi-agent system**, orchestrated using CrewAI. This pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns, where each agent is an expert in its domain.

The primary agents are:

- **Listing Analyst:** A Computer Vision expert that analyzes property photos and listing text to extract key features and data points.
- **Financial Forecaster:** A financial modeling expert that implements the core investment spreadsheet logic, calculating NOI, cash flow, and return metrics.
- **Chief Strategist:** The final decision-maker that synthesizes all data into a clear, human-readable investment thesis.

## How We Model Debt Service

We use a standard **loan amortization model** to compute annual debt service:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Loan Principal (P)] --> B[Monthly Interest Rate (r = annual_rate / 12)]
    B --> C[Total Payments (n = amort_years * 12)]
    C --> D[Monthly Payment (PMT) = (P * r * (1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1)]
    D --> E[Amortization Schedule]
    E --> F[Annual Debt Service, DSCR, Balance]
```

This model feeds into our per-year pro forma:
- **Debt Service** = principal + interest for that year
- **DSCR** = NOI ÷ Debt Service
- **Balance After Year N** = outstanding loan principal

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Orchestration:** CrewAI
- **AI Models:** Computer Vision (CLIP-based tagging), LLM agents
- **Data Modeling:** Pydantic v2
