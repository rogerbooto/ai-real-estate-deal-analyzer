"""
Listing Analyst (V2) — Orchestrator-integrated Tests

Purpose
-------
Ensure the Listing Analyst agent uses the new CV orchestrator and merges
photo-derived condition/defects with text-derived metadata without crashing.

Scenarios
---------
- Text-only: outputs address, amenities, notes; no photo signals.
- Text + photos: rollup condition/defects populated from CV tagging.
- Robust to missing folders/files (forgiving behavior).
