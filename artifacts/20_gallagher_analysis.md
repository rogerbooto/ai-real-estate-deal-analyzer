## Forecasting Methodology

We produce **three parallel valuation tracks** and mark the first year where the loan-to-value (LTV) reaches **≤ 80%** (standard refi-ready threshold). All math is deterministic.

**1) Baseline (Appreciation-Based)**

Property value grows at an assumed annual appreciation rate $g$:

$$Value_t = PurchasePrice \times (1 + g)^t$$
$$LTV_t = \frac{MortgageBalance_t}{Value_t}$$
$$Equity_t^{(80\%)} = 0.80 \times Value_t - MortgageBalance_t$$

**2) Stress-Test (Rate-Anchored, Conservative)**

Anchors value growth to a fraction of today's debt rate $r$ (stress stance). If the model uses an adjustment $Adj$ to reflect effective basis (e.g., subtracting certain upfronts), then:

$$StressValue_t = (PurchasePrice - Adj) \times (1 + \tfrac{r}{3})^t$$
$$LTV_t = \frac{MortgageBalance_t}{StressValue_t}$$
$$Equity_t^{(80\%)} = 0.80 \times StressValue_t - MortgageBalance_t$$

**3) NOI-Based (Market-Income Approach with Cap Rate Drift)**

Values are derived from income with a drifting market cap rate:

$$CapRate_t = CapRate_0 + (drift_{per\_year} \times t)$$
$$NOIValue_t = \frac{NOI_t}{CapRate_t}$$
$$LTV_t = \frac{MortgageBalance_t}{NOIValue_t}$$
$$Equity_t^{(80\%)} = 0.80 \times NOIValue_t - MortgageBalance_t$$

**Notes**
- *Seasoning*: refi checks typically begin at Year 1 or later (configurable).
- We use end-of-year balances and values for consistency.
- LTV comparisons use a small epsilon to avoid floating-point edge cases.
- This report shows the full horizon; refi years are marked when available.


## Investment Thesis

- **Verdict:** CONDITIONAL
- **Rationale:**
  - Day-one DSCR 0.855 and cash-on-cash -13.03 percent indicate weak coverage and an initial cash drain
  - Projected cash flow remains negative through year 5 and turns positive in year 6; DSCR exceeds 1.0 from year 6 and reaches about 1.19 by year 10
  - Cap rate 5.761 percent with 1.061 percent spread to debt rate is below target, leaving limited cushion for shocks
  - Despite weak near-term cash flow, the 10-year IRR of 15.91 percent and strong amortization-driven equity build create attractive long-term economics for a patient hold
  - Subscale single-asset exposure heightens vacancy and operational risk
  - As-is condition, cedar shingles exterior, block foundation, and rented propane furnace and tank imply near-term capex and operating expense leakage; reserves are not modeled
  - Downtown Shediac location with beach and marina access plus 4 bedrooms and potential 5th suggests short-term rental upside not captured in the base underwriting
  - Property taxes may reset on sale; confirm assessment and model a step-up to avoid DSCR erosion
  - Proceed only if one of the following de-risks the file: price reduction, rate buydown, longer amortization, or brief interest-only period to achieve year-1 DSCR at least 1.20 and positive cash-on-cash
  - Alternative path: validate STR legality and underwrite an STR program or an additional legal bedroom to lift year-1 NOI to at least 16165 to meet 1.20x coverage on current debt service
  - Eliminate or credit back rented propane equipment costs at close and fund an adequate initial reserve
  - If conditions cannot be met, pass due to thin spread and early negative cash flow
