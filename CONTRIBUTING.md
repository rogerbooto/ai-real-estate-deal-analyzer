## Coding Standards

* Follow **PEP8** conventions.

* We use **ruff** for linting and formatting. Run:

  ```bash
  ruff check .
  ruff format .
  ```

* Type hints are required (`mypy` is used in CI).

* Write tests for new features or bug fixes.

* Keep functions small and opinionated â€” one responsibility per function.

---

## Commit Messages

Use clear, conventional commits:

* `feat:` for new features
* `fix:` for bug fixes
* `test:` for adding/updating tests
* `docs:` for documentation changes
* `refactor:` for non-breaking code cleanup

Example:

```text
feat(financial_model): add mortgage insurance integration
```

## Pull Requests

* Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
* Ensure tests and linting pass locally before pushing.
* Provide a clear description of your change and motivation.
* PRs should remain focused (avoid bundling unrelated changes).
