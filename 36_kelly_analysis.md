## Investment Thesis

- **Verdict:** CONDITIONAL
- **Rationale:**
  - 10-year levered IRR of 16.81% supported by a year-10 cash-out refi of $89.23k; strong projected returns are largely driven by very low initial equity ($29,995).
  - Going-in DSCR is 0.87 with Year-1 cash-on-cash of -12.67% and negative cash flow (-$3,799); cumulative carry required in Years 1–5 is about -$10,446, with DSCR only exceeding 1.0 in Year 6.
  - Cap rate of 6.35% provides a thin 0.845% spread versus debt, below the 1.5% target; limited risk premium against rate/expense shocks.
  - Underwriting shows $0 for repairs/maintenance, property management, and reserves; NOI is likely overstated—normalize OPEX to avoid downside surprises.
  - Refi at Year 10 increases annual debt service to ~$37.9k, pushing DSCR <1.0 for Years 11–13 and adding roughly -$5,531 of additional negative cash flow before stabilizing.
  - Asset positives: renovated legal duplex, separate meters, tenant-paid electric, upper unit vacant for immediate mark-to-market—supports income growth and operational simplicity.
  - Key risks: subscale (2 units) amplifies vacancy/turnover volatility; electric baseboard heat—confirm tenants pay and leases reflect it; no garage is minor.
  - Proceed only if you can: (a) improve price/terms or increase down payment to achieve DSCR ≥1.15 and positive cash flow at acquisition under normalized expenses, or (b) obtain a rate buydown/seller credit to cover expected carry; verify legal status, taxes, and market rents and include prudent capital reserves.
